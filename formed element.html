    <h3 style="text-align: center;">THE FORMED ELEMENTS OF BLOOD INCLUDE:</h3>
    <p class="blood">1.Red Blood Cells</p>
    <p>Red blood cells (also referred to as erythrocytes) are the most
        common cell type in the blood and are the principle means
        of delivering oxygen to cells via the circulatory system.
        The cellâ€™s cytoplasm is rich in Hgb, an iron-containing biomolecule that readily binds with oxygen and is responsible
        for the bloodâ€™s red color. Erythrocytes are produced in the bone
        marrow and circulate for about 100 to 120 days before they
        are recycled by macrophages</p>
    <p class="white">2.White Blood Cells</p>
    <p>White blood cells, or leukocytes, are delivered by the blood
            to sites of infection or tissue disruption, where they defendthe body against infecting organisms and foreign agents in
            conjunction with antibodies and protein cofactors in blood.</p>
    <p class="platelets">3.Platelets</p>
    <p>Platelets or thrombocytes are the formed elements of
        blood. Platelets are small colorless, non-nucleated and
        moderately refractive bodies. These formed elements of
        blood are considered to be the fragments of cytoplasm</p>
